# Onboarding Flow Redesign Plan

## Overview
Implement a new onboarding flow with multiple screens, each matching the provided designs. The first screen will be the existing Theme selection page, followed by new screens for Gallery intro and Cmd+K shortcut info.

## Steps

1. **Update Onboarding Flow Structure**
   - Place the Theme selection page as the first onboarding screen.
   - Add new components for each onboarding screen based on the provided designs.

2. **Design Implementation**
   - Recreate the layout, colors, typography, and button styles using Tailwind CSS to match the screenshots exactly.
   - Ensure all text and button content matches the designs.

3. **Responsiveness**
   - Prioritize desktop layout.
   - Add basic responsiveness for smaller screens as a bonus.

4. **Navigation**
   - Keep navigation logic (`Next`, `Back`, `Finish`) as in the current flow.
   - Update button styles and placement to match the new design.

5. **File Changes**
   - Refactor `OnboardingScreen2.tsx` to match the Gallery intro design.
   - Create `OnboardingScreen3.tsx` for the Cmd+K shortcut info screen.
   - Update `OnboardingFlow.tsx` to use the Theme page, `OnboardingScreen2`, and `OnboardingScreen3` in sequence.
   - (Optional) Update or create a CSS file if any global styles are needed.
